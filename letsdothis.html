// While I found numerous examples online of Hangman games, they each used some command or other syntax that we had not learned.  I spent 
// some of my time interpreting how their games worked, and while I could have inserted their code and simply messed around with the CSS to make it
// -look- like a new game, I chose not to, since I wanted to see if I could "solve" the javascript.

// So, I reviewed all of our class material from this week and had plenty of "eureka!" moments of seeing where techniques we had learned could be applied.  
// I definitely think I could finish this with some more time (if I'd started by reviewing the daily lessons and applying them day by day from the start,
// I'd have been able to do this in time) but I hope to leave some pseudocode (of the javascript, mainly) here as a reference.


//JAVASCRIPT


//Make an array of all possible words

var words = [
            "javascript",
            "css",
            "html",
            "jquery"
        ];


// numerous global variables should be listed here at the top, such as 
// var wins = 0;             <------- would be adjusted later by wins++

//Pick a random word

var index = Math.floor(Math.random() * words.length);

var word = words[index];
console.log(word)

//fill an array with placeholders for guessing

var answer = []

for (var i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
    answer[i] = "_";
}
console.log("answer is " + answer);
